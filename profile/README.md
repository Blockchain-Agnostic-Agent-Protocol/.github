# Blockchain Agnostic Agent Protocol (BAAP)

A cross-chain agent swarm protocol enabling autonomous agent coordination across blockchain networks. Built with TypeScript and powered by LangGraph.

## 🌟 Vision

We envision a future where autonomous agents seamlessly interact across different blockchain networks, creating a rich ecosystem of cross-chain applications and services.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Cross-Chain Agent Coordination**: Create agents that work together across different blockchain networks
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend and customize agent capabilities
- **Type-Safe Development**: Built with TypeScript for reliable development
- **Robust State Management**: Reliable state handling across agent swarms
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Developer-First**: Great developer experience with extensive tooling
