# Blockchain Agnostic Agent Protocol - Cross-Chain Agent Swarm Protocol

Blockchain Agnostic Agent Protocol is an open protocol that enables developers to build and coordinate autonomous agent swarms across multiple blockchain networks. Built with TypeScript and powered by LangGraph, it provides a robust foundation for creating interoperable blockchain agents.

## üåü Vision

We envision a future where autonomous agents can seamlessly interact across different blockchain networks, creating a rich ecosystem of cross-chain applications and services. Blockchain Agnostic Agent Protocol aims to be the foundational protocol that makes this vision a reality.

## üöÄ Core Features

- **Cross-Chain Agent Coordination**: Create agents that work together across different blockchain networks
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend and customize agent capabilities
- **Type-Safe Development**: Built with TypeScript for reliable development
- **Robust State Management**: Reliable state handling across agent swarms
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Developer-First**: Great developer experience with extensive tooling
